# JavaScript Form Validation

This project demonstrates client-side form validation using vanilla JavaScript.

It validates user input in real-time and on form submission, providing feedback for each field (full name, email, password, confirm password, and checkbox).

## Features

- Checks for empty input fields
- Validates full name format (letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes)
- Validates email structure
- Ensures password length and match
- Confirms checkbox is selected
- Shows success or error messages with styling

## Files Included ðŸ“‚

index.html â€“ Form structure
style.css â€“ Basic styling and error/success UI
script.js â€“ JavaScript logic for validation

## Notes

1. This is a project to demonstrate form validation logic.
2. No backend is connectedâ€”it's purely frontend/client-side.
3. Easily extendable to include more complex rules or validations.
